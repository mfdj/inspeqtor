# Inspeqtor

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mperham/inspeqtor?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mperham/inspeqtor)

Inspeqtor monitors your application infrastructure.  It gathers and verifies key metrics
from all the moving parts in your application and alerts you when something
looks wrong.  It understands the application deployment workflow so it
won't bother you during a deploy.

What it does:

* Monitor init.d-, systemd-, upstart-, runit- or launchd-managed services
* Monitor process memory and CPU usage
* Monitor daemon-specific metrics (e.g. redis, memcached, mysql, nginx...)
* Monitor and alert based on host CPU, load, swap and disk usage
* Alert or restart a process if a rule threshold is breached
* Alert if a process disappears or changes PID
* Signal deploy start/stop to silence alerts during deploy

What it doesn't:

* monitor or control arbitrary processes, services must be init-managed
* have *any* runtime dependencies at all, not even libc.

If you've used `monit` before, Inspeqtor will look familiar.  Same
high-level goals but in a modern package.

## Status

Inspeqtor is **feature complete**, reliable and (mostly?) bug-free.  This repo
does not see a lot of code changes because of this, not because it is unmaintained.


## Installation

See the [Inspeqtor wiki](https://github.com/mperham/inspeqtor/wiki) for complete documentation.


## Requirements

Linux 3.0+.  It will run on OS X.  FreeBSD is untested.  It uses about 5-10MB of RAM at runtime.


## Upgrade

[Inspeqtor Pro](http://contribsys.com/inspeqtor) is the commercial upgrade for Inspeqtor and offers more
features, dedicated support and a non-GPL license:

* Monitor cron job execution
* Export metrics to Statsd
* Route alerts to different teams or individuals
* Send alerts to Slack or other team chat rooms
* More to come...
